                <h2>What is Muay Thai?</h2>

                <p>Muay Thai, which translates to “Thai Boxing”, is the national sport of Thailand. It is a martial art
                    with
                    roots originating from military use dating back to around the 13th century during the time of the
                    Sukhothai Kingdom. </p>


                <p> Muay Thai is known as the “Art of 8 limbs” because it makes use of 8 points of contact namely,
                    punches,
                    elbows, knees and kicks. This differs it from other stand-up combat sports such as boxing (2 points
                    -
                    fists) and karate (4 points - fists and feet).
                </p>

                <p> Muay Thai is a stand-up striking sport, with two competitors in the ring throwing punches, elbows,
                    knees
                    and kicks at each other. Clinching, sweeps and throws are also allowed. Besides the 8-point contact,
                    a
                    key difference between Muay Thai and many other stand-up combat sports is its emphasis on
                    traditional
                    elements such as the pre-fight dance ritual known as Wai Kru Ram Muay, the head dress (Mongkon) and
                    the
                    Sarama music that accompanies each fight.

                    Today, Muay Thai is practised and competed not only in Thailand, but also all around the world.</p>
